# Wirebrain

Wirebrain is a basic C# console chatbot that responds to simple text commands.

It logs all messages to a CSV file and can analyze those logs to find commonly used words. The long-term goal is for it to learn from past conversations and improve its responses over time.

Still very early and experimental.
